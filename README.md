## Description
        
In this project, I created a program that allows a user to input as many employees as they wish of three varying sorts: intern, engineer and manager. Each of these employee's contain 3 shared characteristics, and 1 unique characteristic. The user will be prompted for the 3 shared characteristics, and afterwards be asked which type of employee they wish to enter. They will then be asked for the last unique characteristic given which type of employee they choose. When the user is done inputting new employees, an html page is rendered with a tile of each employee that displays all of the information that the user chose to enter. 

## Installation 

You must get the entire "develop" folder in the repository and invoke app.js with node. To see the html page, go to the folder 'output' in 'develop'. 

## Usage

Invoke using node "node app.js".
